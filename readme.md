Hello, I'm the new database engineer in town as of 2025. I was trained on Coursera, and this is my capstone project. You can update the open source project. The objective is to create a database and exclusive report for a little_lemon% with quality programming skills. When you see this, it means you are on my repository, learning from a proficient database engineer. Cheers!
